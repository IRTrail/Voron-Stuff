This simply mounts a switch in the umbilical cover which I modified from Minsekt:

I added counterbores to the face screws and changed the diameter to 9mm which is perfect for a piece of 3/8" polyethelyne tubing from the local Ace Hardware as an umbilical support. I have settled on the Mellow FLY-SB2040 which uses a connector with two small terminals that aren't JST or anything I know of. Thus, I am kinda stuck using their wire harness and no nifty CANBUS cable.

Here's some pics:
