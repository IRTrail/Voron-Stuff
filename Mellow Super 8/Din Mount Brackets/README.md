# Mellow FLY-Super 8 DIN mount
This is my version of a mounting bracket for the Super 8. It uses the [Voron 2.4R2 DIN clips](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2 "Voron 2.4R2 DIN clips").
The clips are included in the .3mf and .stl files for your printing leisure.
The cad file has the clips and the [Mellow Super 8 CAD file](https://github.com/Mellow-3D/Fly-SB2040/blob/main/Hardware/SB2040.step "Mellow CAD file") included.
