This simply mounts a switch in the umbilical cover which I modified from Minsekt:

Pretty fantastic work there Minsekt. Thanks!

I added counterbores to the face screws and changed the diameter to 9mm which is perfect for a piece of 3/8" polyethelyne tubing from the local Ace Hardware as an umbilical support. I have settled on the Mellow FLY-SB2040 which uses a connector with two small terminals that aren't JST or anything I know of. Thus, I am kinda stuck using their wire harness and no nifty CANBUS cable.

Here's some pics:
This view shows the face of the umbilical connector. There should be enough room to fit one of the socket head screws typically used for mounting the micro switch. I believe they are 1.5 mm sheet metal screws. If you have interference issues, try some button head screws.

This view shows the switch and how it contacts the rail.
It is centered on the rail, so it shouln't matter which way the switch tab sticks. I put mine up. Because it felt like an up day. Just saying.

This is another view. You can tell it's another view because of the view...

This is the top down view which is what all engineers expect to see six months after their first job. Little do they know...
