# Pika Buffer Mods
## _Modifications I created for the Pika Buffer_

### Pika Buffer Bottom mount for extrusions
This simply lets you mount the Pika buffer to 2020 extgrusions in the same spacing as the ERCF uses.

### Pika Buffer Top Magnets Recessed
This has recesses in the top pieces so the magnets have some support. This helps when the reverse bowden has a curve that tries to unlatch the magnet attachment. This is only the 10mm version with two magnets. If you want the other version, reach out to me.
