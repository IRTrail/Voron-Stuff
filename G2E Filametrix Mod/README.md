# G2E and Filametrix
## _Modifications for the G2E to have a Filametrix cutter._
These parts are at the conceptual stage currently. If you use them and find issues, please let me know via DM through discord @ silverback_attack. I am still in the process of printing and installing this setup. There will likely be updates.
Also, understand there is no CAD released for the G2 stuff. Reverse engineering it is a total PITA. Ergo, there will likely be some slicer complaints because the stls aren't "water tight."
Use at your own risk. It's not my fault your sister is ugly or your tongue hurts when you lick a 9V battery...or anything else. Just saying.

### G2E Parts:
These are modified from the STLs of the G2E. You'll need to print a front and back. Then put the heatset insert in per the Filametrix Method.

### Filametrix Parts:
This is just the arm which has been modified to not interfere with the G2E motor.
