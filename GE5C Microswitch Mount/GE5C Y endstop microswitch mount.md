This simply mounts a switch in the front of a thin GE5C Z rail mount.
Longer screws are needed. I am not sure how long yet, will update later.
The small switch mounting screws should work from your old switch pod under the XY joint.
It should print in whichever orientation you choose, except lugs down. I plan on putting the lugs up.

Here's some pics:
