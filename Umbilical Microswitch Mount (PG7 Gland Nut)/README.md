I integrated the Y endstop switch into the cover. It will fit...snugly. You might have to work on it with the back of your Xacto knife blade a bit to get the switch in. It is meant to be a tight fit, since there are no screws to hold it.

Print it with ABS or ASA. Don't use PETG or PLA for the heated chamber because it WILL warp and you might crash your X rail on homing, or all your babies will be born naked. Don't blame me for either!

Here is the link for Hartk's CW2 Umbilical. I used the `cw2_umbPG7_skinnyy.step` file without alteration. Thanks to Hartk.
