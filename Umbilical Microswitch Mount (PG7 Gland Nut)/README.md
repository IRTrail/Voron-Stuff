This is a remix of:
    https://github.com/hartk1213/MISC/tree/main/Voron%20Mods/Voron%202/2.4/CW2_SB2040_CAN_Umbilical

I integrated the Y endstop switch into the cover. It will fit...snugly. You might have to work on it with the back of your Xacto knife blade a bit to get the switch in. It is meant to be a tight fit, since there are no screws to hold it.

Print it with ABS or ASA. Don't use PETG or PLA for the heated chamber because it WILL warp and you might crash your X rail on homing, or all your babies will be born naked. Don't blame me for either!

Somewhere, someone remixed the above link and made a "skiny" CW2 mount. I completely apologize, because I didn't save the link, so I cannot give proper credit. This irks me, so if you know where it came from, let me know and I shall give credit post haste.

Here's some pics:
