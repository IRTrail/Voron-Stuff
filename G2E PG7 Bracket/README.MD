# PG7 Bracket for the G2E
## Simple, yet effective.
This is a modification of the standard G2E cable chain bracket to use a PG7 bracket for an umbilical attachment.
It mounts the same, uses the same bolt. You'll notice there is a slot in the threaded portion which allows the cables to pass through in the event you have already soldered or crimped on connections which won't fit through the hole. That makes this V2, and I'll bet you have a good idea of why V1 didn't work... o.O
Just remember NOT to tighten the bolt fully before you thread in the PG7 gland. After that is seated, tighten the bolt.
There is a built in support for printing. Sorry, I couldn't figure any other way. If you have other supports, you should be able to delete the support body in the slicer and proceed as usual.
